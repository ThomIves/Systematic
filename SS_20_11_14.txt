SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytics Friends,

INTEGRATION! This word has rich conceptual meaning.

I was thrilled when I first saw the power of
numerical integration to predict system dynamics.

BUT WAIT - THERE's MORE!

I have DEEP respect for those that used analog computers.

One "REALLY" needed to know math & physics well,
and how devices stored, released, or dissipated energy
to gain insights from them, BUT analog computers had limits.

Numerical integration also requires good appreciation
of math and physics.

Solutions take too long when integration steps are too SMALL.
Solutions are inaccurate when integration steps are too BIG.

There's art in finding the best step size.

HERE is the "THERE's MORE" part:

Integration also applies to REVIEW - LEARN - TRY growth cycles.

If we try to learn every SMALL detail, we move too slow.
If we try to learn in BIG steps, we miss necessary details.
But we must INTEGRATE our learning to make the best progress.

To those providing constructive comments & challenging
questions to this series - thank you!

Let's grow this model together for our combined benefit.

See a link to my "Integrating Brilliance" talk in the
comments if you want more thoughts on concepts of integration.
