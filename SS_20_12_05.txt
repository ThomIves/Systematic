""" CONTROL """

SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytics Friends,

"CONTROL" as in control system design is awesome!

A system's controller is PURELY goal oriented!

It looks at the desired states - GOALS.
It measures or predicts the CURRENT states.
It measures the ERROR between the GOALS and CURRENT states.
It sends FEEDBACK to the system to move the CURRENT states towards the GOALS.
Frequent FEEDBACK ensures system stability.

HOWEVER, a controller does OTHER important functions too!
It rejects noise and handles disturbances.
If the system doesn't handle these well, the system can become unstable.

We are adding """ CONTROL """ to our growth model this week:
. Let's grow in skill to filter noise.
. Let's grow in our abilities to handle disturbances.
. Let's grow in seeing our TRUE STATES as we receive signals in our lives.

What are examples of how to do this?
When someone is harsh towards us, look for the TRUTH.
. If we filter their seemingly mean spirit, is there TRUTH in their statements?
... Use that TRUTH as helpful feedback.
. Is someone praising you only to get on your good side?
... Filter it, be nice, and pursue your GOALS.

Always CARE about finding your TRUE states
And work toward your GOALS (goal states).

Where do your GOALS come from?
Your WHY.
