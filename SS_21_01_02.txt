"""  LEARN  by  EXPLORING "BROADLY"  """

SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytics Friends,

Last week's Systematic Saturday post proposed
how to best start new LEARNing processes.

I expressed what I had learned from watching
my ðŸ‘‰ "reinforced learning agent ðŸ”´" ðŸ‘ˆ
LEARN.

When learning new stuff, EXPLORE many references
at a high level.

A helpful thing from grad school?
Start with simple references.

Recently, I burned out reading transformer papers.
So many questions!

I decided to try some "YouTube" videos ... I WAS AMAZED

Yannic Kilcher:
ðŸ‘‰ "Attention Is All You Need"
The A.I. Hacker - Michael Phi:
ðŸ‘‰ "Illustrated Guide to Transformers Neural Network:
... A step by step explanation"
Seattle Applied Deep Learning:
ðŸ‘‰ "LSTM is dead. Long Live Transformers"
CodeEmporium
ðŸ‘‰ "Transformer Neural Networks - EXPLAINED! (Attention is all you need)"
ðŸ‘‰ "BERT Neural Network - EXPLAINED!"

Again, ðŸ‘† are YouTube Videos.

Bigger takeaway for NEW LEARNing?
BROADLY! From simple to complex.
BROADLY! From videos to journal papers.
BROADLY! Form a diverse learning group.

Please see comments.
