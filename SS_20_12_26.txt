""" MULTIPLE GROWTH PATHS """

SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytics Friends,

The last few weeks, we walked thru the
development of a general growth path model.
(Top comment has links to posts that track
the development).

A single growth path can continue for a lifetime.
Multiple grow paths can continue for a lifetime.

What happens if we aren't examining and
remaining cognizant of our growth paths?

What happens if we do not seek to grow
in cognizance of our growth amount,
of our growth quality, and of how we grow?

What happens if we do not seek to
constantly improve our growth model(s);

In my humble and "humbled" opinion, It isn't good!

We learn amazing concepts in science and math.
We also learn amazing concepts outside science and math.

We can abstract those amazing concepts
and use them to help us improve our
growth models for all realms over time.

I have suggested a single growth model
that I believe works well across multiple
realms = good parsimony IMHO.

I am seeking to apply it.
What's the best model for YOU?
The one that helps YOU grow best!

Use this one; use your own; use a hybrid.

What seems most important,
Socratically speaking,
is to have a model that helps YOU
remain cognizant of YOUR growth amount
and of YOUR growth quality.
