""" LEARN  by  EXPLORING """

SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytics Friends,

I'm LATE! âŒš Late this day ðŸŒ‡
that's the next day ðŸ“… in a late time zone â›°

Why? LEARNing how to LEARN better.

Please don't judge me ðŸ™‚
ACTUALLY - JUDGE ME!

This last FANATIC FRIDAY celebrated
it's 1st virtual being - ðŸ”´
My li'l red virtual dot with a
reinforcement LEARNing mind.
See link to post in comments.

WHY did it take me this long to understand
how to best start a new LEARNing process?

WHY did it take programming ðŸ”´ to
move in a virtual environment to see
how to best start to LEARN something new?

I followed what ðŸ”´ taught me, tried it,
and it worked!

WHEN drawing the image for this latest
growth post, it hit me "why" EXPLORATION speeds
early LEARNing.

I did learn this previously,
but almost didn't remember!

Army scouts explore "broadly" in initial
reconnaissance. If they don't, ouch!

Limited time is our enemy.
Explore many references at a high level.
Think, reflect, explore more, think, reflect
... repeat = Faster Learning AND Insights!

Learning something new? See if this helps.
Already using it? Please share how it helps you.
