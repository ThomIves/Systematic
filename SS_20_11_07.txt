SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytics Friends,

I am "CONTINUING" to examine “the efforts in” my life
per encouragements from Socrates "and" Plato.

Growth, among many things to me, is a process of
reducing my blindness and ignorance.

But what can slow down, or stop, my reduction of
blindness and ignorance?

What can even increase my blindness and ignorance?

ARROGANCE.

Confession: I know this from first hand experience - ouch!

Arrogance is almost always associated with mindsets such as:
* “I know more than you”
* “I am a master at this”
* “I wish people would just shut up and listen to me”

What attitude helps reduce blindness and ignorance the most?

HUMILITY.

Relief: I know this trait from experience too - thank God!

Humility is almost always associated with mindsets such as:
* “I can learn from everyone and everything around me”
* “I love to learn and grow so much that I will ask my seemingly embarrassing questions”
* “I am never a master of anything. I want to be a student of everything.”

SUMMARY:
*** Arrogance tends to increase blindness and ignorance
*** Humility helps to rapidly decrease blindness and ignorance
