SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytics Friends,

Thermodynamics = System Dynamics!

1st Law of Thermodynamics: Energy is conserved.

For a defined system

... Energy_In - Energy_Out = Energy_Stored

1st law => the QUANTITY of energy.

#######

2nd Law of Thermodynamics: "Energies" can have
different levels of QUALITY.

Think deeply about the 2nd law, that's what it's about.

2nd Law => The QUALITY of energy!

#######

Can we conceptualize these principles
and use them to help us go about
learning and growing better?

YES!

POWER is a change in ENERGY per TIME

LEARNING POWER can be our GROWTH per TIME

Our GROWTH being our growth
in skills and "know how".

We can only gain a limited amount of
knowledge in our lives, so
pursue high QUALITY knowledge,
since the QUANTITY will be limited.

Knowledge alone won't help us grow best.
We need to USE it - put it into practice.

We can only perform a limited amount of
practice in our lives, so
pursue high QUALITY practice,
since the QUANTITY will be limited.

These foci will MAXIMIZE our LEARNING POWER
