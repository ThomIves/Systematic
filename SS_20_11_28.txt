SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytics Friends,

""" WHY """

I often think and pray for hours in the middle of the night in bed ... I love this time.

Last night's thoughts took me to a dramatic existential crisis climax followed by an even more profound resolution.

Recognition: "SURVIVAL" is core to my "WHY" in life.

But this is just a foundation to a greater WHY - "MORE".

However, if "MORE" is a goal for myself alone, I am convinced it will fall short of a GREATER potential.

"MORE TOGETHER" - that's it. That's my WHY.

Our growth model must ask WHY.

For greatest effectiveness and efficiency, our growth goals
* must be guided by an "ALL ENCOMPASSING" WHY, and
* must be guided by small WHY's that connect to our main WHY.

IMHO "growth" is most powerful when done together.

In our advanced human society, we earn income that allows us to spend money on our basic needs and MORE. This is not a perfect system.

My WHY is for us to find ways to have MORE TOGETHER.

I can keep THIS "WHY" even when I leave this life.
