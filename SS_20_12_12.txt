... """ REST """ ...

SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytic Friends,

REST is essential to GROWth.

It is the fuel of RECOVERY.

I used to hate needing to rest ... to take breaks.

I wanted to keep going!
... Grow Faster
... Grow Stronger
... Grow In Knowledge
... Grow in Accomplishment

I was missing the most important GROWth component.
REST is needed for GROWth!

BUT I saw it, ONLY, as an unwanted necessity
and NOT as an amazing benefit!

I've burned myself out TOO MANY times in my past.

Somewhere along the way, I started taking REST seriously.

I started to seek it more for it's amazing benefits.

I can't explain why:
... rest makes the mind grow well ...
... taking breaks brings insights ...

But rest and breaks help beyond my comprehension.

I actually stayed up late refactoring the model
and taking it beyond this point,
but I chose to focus ONLY on REST today!

Since I did stay up late,
I think I'll go take a nap!

"""A RESTED MIND IS A SHARP MIND"""

We in #datascience need sharp minds.
