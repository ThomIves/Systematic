SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: #data and #analytics Friends,

I am examining “the efforts in” my life per encouragement from Socrates.

The pseudo code:
....My_Living = REVIEW + LEARN + TRY
........IF SOLVE Better:
............GROW
............Call My_Living
........IF Worse:
............ReRun My_Living

Does this model have good parsimony?

Does it generalize well?

Can this model help us better grow through more awareness?

Will it help with the big 3: 1) Spirit, 2) Mind, 3) Body?

I’ll explore answers to these questions as a series for Saturdays.

I’ll return each Saturday with true confessions.

For now, I will apply it to simpler endeavors like
reinforced learning!

This question is far more difficult than that I feel.
