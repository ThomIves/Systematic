""" LEARN by EXPLAINING TO OTHERS """

SYSTEMATIC SATURDAY: Friends,

Last week's post promoted
BROAD exploration of LEARN'ing resources when
LEARN'ing new things.

Models reveal integrations of brilliant
pieces and HOW they relate.

The pictured model is wrong and incomplete!

Why use it? """ It's useful! """

It relates many wise things given to me.

Hard to understand? Make your own!
Want to understand this one more?

This week I add EXPLAIN'ing.

My "OLD" grad school buddies would ask
for help when we'd hit a wall in our research.

Most of the time, the one posing the question
would get an idea and say,

"Thanks for listening."

When we'd teach, we'd understand concepts better.
When we'd present and answer questions, still more.

Joe White, a famous Australian psychologist
who learned from aborigine culture explains it best -
telling stories "thickens" those thoughts.

Tell your LEARN'ing story. Pose questions.
Search for, Read, and Listen to answers.
EXPLAIN your LEARN'ing in your own words.
Seek feedback on your EXPLAIN'ings.
Thicken your LEARN'ing story by EXPLAIN'ing!
